# red-hat-kaggle

When finished, this project will produce a machine learning analysis for the Red Hat competition on Kaggle.

It does not include the data, which needs to be separately downloaded from here:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/predicting-red-hat-business-value

The data must be unzipped and placed in a subdirectory called "Data" in the directory that contains red_hat.py.
